# Simulog - Multi Character Private Server Launcher For Ashita V2
![Simulog](http://i.imgur.com/VuOgKtz.png)

# Purpose
Simulog allows multiple characters to be logged in simultaneously. It works with the Ashita client and is designed for private servers. Rather than logging on each character individually, it logs on an unlimited number of characters all at once, reducing the time it takes to begin multiboxing. 

# Important!
Ask your server administrator if it's okay to use this program. Logging in many characters too fast or frequently can have a disrupting effect on the server. A server administrator could mistake this as an attack on their server which can result in rate limiting or banning from the server. 

# Repository

# Frequently Asked Questions

**How is my account information being handled?**

Your account information is handled the same way the Ashita client handles them, by storing them in configuration files in the boot_command section, so there is no added security risk. 

**Does the program connect to the internet?**

This program never has to connect to the internet. All of the game operations are still handled by the Ashita client. 

**Does the program allow logging characters into different servers?**

The program only allows characters to be logged in the same server.
